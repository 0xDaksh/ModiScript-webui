## Vision 
A Programming language is a wonderful medium of communication between man and machine. Many such languages are created, keeping in mind the comfort of the programmer. Such languages fulfill the computational needs of the world and serve their purpose. Somewhere in the midst of all this, the “fun” side of programming is lost. <br/>
Our project, “Modi Script” is one such esoteric language created with the sole intention of parodying our beloved PM Narendra Modi. The star feature of this language is that the language consists entirely of remarkable statements made by the PM. The language is  dynamically typed and  turing complete, sprinkled with words of wisdom by our PM! <br/>
